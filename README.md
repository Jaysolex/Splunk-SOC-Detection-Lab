# Splunk SOC Detection Lab

End-to-end SOC detection lab using **Windows Event Logs (Event ID 4688)**, **Sysmon**, and **Splunk** to detect **LOLBins** mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

---

## Objective

This lab demonstrates a **real-world SOC detection pipeline**, from Windows telemetry generation to SIEM-based detection and investigation.

Key objectives:

- Monitor Windows process creation (**Event ID 4688**)
- Enrich telemetry with **Sysmon**
- Detect **Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins)**
- Perform **command-line and parent–child analysis**
- Map detections to **MITRE ATT&CK**
- Build analyst-ready Splunk searches

---

## SOC Architecture

![SOC Architecture](architecture/soc-architecture.png)

**Description**

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end SOC detection architecture used in this lab.

Windows endpoints generate **Security Event Logs (4688)** and **Sysmon telemetry**, which are collected by the **Splunk Universal Forwarder** and forwarded to **Splunk Enterprise** for detection, investigation, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

---

## Data Sources

- Windows Security Event Logs (Event ID 4688)
- Sysmon (Process Create, Command Line)
- Splunk Universal Forwarder

---

## Detection Use Cases

The following techniques and LOLBins are monitored:

- PowerShell abuse
- Rundll32 LOLBin execution
- Regsvr32 abuse
- Mshta command execution
- Certutil file download abuse
- WMI and script interpreter abuse

### 🔟 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping  
**Screenshot:** 

![Alt text](screenshots/10-mitre-attack-mapping.png)  

Detected activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, including:

- **T1059.001 – PowerShell**
- **T1218.011 – Rundll32**
- **T1218.010 – Regsvr32**

MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping (Explanation)

### T1059.001 – PowerShell

**What it is**  

Abuse of PowerShell, a powerful Windows scripting engine commonly used by attackers.

**Why attackers use it**

- Installed by default
- Powerful scripting and execution
- Often trusted by security controls

**How it appears in this lab**

- Event ID 4688 process creation
- `powershell.exe` as `NewProcessName`
- Suspicious command-line usage


### T1218.011 – Rundll32

**What it is**

Abuse of rundll32.exe, a legitimate Windows binary used to execute code within DLL files.

Why attackers use it

Signed Microsoft binary (trusted)

Executes arbitrary DLL functions

Frequently abused to evade application whitelisting

How it appears in this lab

rundll32.exe launched with unusual DLLs

Suspicious command-line arguments

Parent processes such as cmd.exe or unexpected system binaries


### T1218.010 – Regsvr32

**What it is**

Abuse of regsvr32.exe, normally used to register or unregister DLLs.

**Why attackers use it**

Trusted Microsoft binary

Can execute code via DLL registration

Historically abused for fileless execution

How it appears in this lab

regsvr32.exe executing DLLs outside standard install paths

Silent execution flags (e.g. /s)

Abnormal parent–child process relationships


**Why This Matters**

Mapping detections to MITRE ATT&CK allows SOC analysts to:

Understand attacker behavior, not just raw logs

Standardize detections across environments

Prioritize alerts based on known adversary techniques

Communicate findings clearly during investigations

This lab demonstrates how raw Windows telemetry can be transformed into threat-informed, MITRE-aligned detections.
